# DuskbornCodeLou
This is the code showcase of what I worked on in Duskborn


In this repository you can find all my C++ Code, but be aware that I have not worked on everything alone. The engineering head of the project Fabio Mangiameli has helped me a lot and I canÂ´t take the sole credit for the code. But I have done most of it.

If you are interested in the Blueprints I made you can find them with these links:

Sadly a lot of the Blueprints I made have been lost because other people have worked on them recently, so I could only "safe" these two
